# Sorting-web-application written in Java
## Applcation uses GWT
### Good Luck
This application sorts data in the table by first column, then by second (if the numbers or the words are the same in the first column) and so on. All row's data have to stay together after sorting.
Every number in the column has to be above the above the word.
The numbers/words are seperated by space.
